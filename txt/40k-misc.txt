Assorted Tyranid/Genestealer Tidbits

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These are little bits of information and other things that I have had
happen.

[-- ]Hive Tyrants, Tyranid Warriors automatically pass LD based tests. This
includes LD based Psychic attacks.

[-- ]Units within 18" of the Hive Tyrant and 12" of a Tyranid Warroir also
automatically pass any LD based tests. This again also includes LD based
Psychic attacks.

[-- ]One Purestrain Genestealer is more than a match for almost any Space
Marine in Terminator armor.

[-- ]Five Purestrains were able to do 3 points of damage to a Bloodthister
in one round of HTH. Four of them lived to fight again.

[-- ]Don't forget that Tyranids and Genestealers cause fear and/or Terror!
(I always do.)

[-- ]Aren't the Tyranid Bio-Weapons supposed to cause fear? (page 65 of
rule book)

[-- ]As of Oct. 9, 1994, the Space Wolves have more personalities than
there are things to chose from in both the Tyranid and Genestealer army
lists!

[-- ]Acording to the GW rep. on America On-Line, Zoats are gone for good.
However, whether the Barbed Strangler is gone remains to be seen.
