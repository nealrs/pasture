This page will be updates as I learn/create more strategies.
All these strategies on this page are based on my experiences playing
WH40k. I say this because I have only been playing for about a year. I also
have played some very odd games. For example, in one game I was playing
against Imperial Gaurd. My opponent had one of his normal squads run from
cover to the base of a hill I was behind. After seeing the distance he
moved them I had him measure. The squad moved 18". I complained, so he
moved them back to 14" inches. I complained again. He moved them back to
10". I gave up complaning and finished the battle (it was close, but I
lost). Just a little bit of background information.
Here are a bunch of strategies for the individual models, folowed by some
army/unit strategies. Again, I will update these pages as I learn more,
people send me ideas, and after the codex comes out. In case you missed it,
the codex is planned on being released in the first quater of 1995.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Image]Hive Tyrant:

Do not field. It is not worth the 264 points right now. For proof, compare
the Hive Tyrant (264 points) to either a Keeper of Secrets (200 points) or
a Lord of Change (245 points). However, I wrote into the GW rep. on AOL
with my questions and he said that the Hive Tyrant will be well worth its
points when the codex comes out.

[Image]Genestealer Patriarch:

Well, you can't give this guy anything. I take him because he is a Psyker
and the Hive Tyrant is too expensive.(see above) I also take this guy
because it gives helps prevent the automatic loss of game if my Magus dies.

[Image]Genestealer Magus:

I usually give my Magus:

   * Power Field (35 points, Wargear Card)
   * Psychic Hood (25 points, Wargear Card)
   * Bionic Eye (5 Points, Wargear Card)
   * Plasma Gun(8 points)
   * Plasma Piston(4 points)
   * Force Rod(10 points)

Total = 194 points
The Magus will die in hth so keep him out. A basic Imperial Gaurd soilder
is perfectly able to take him down. So keep the Magus near some HTH troops
(Purestrains) and let the power field protect him from shots.

[Image]Tyranid Warrior:

I have found that having 2 with Deathspitters and 1 with Boneswords works
pretty well. Also, just takeing 3 with Deathspitters is also a good bet.
Only take 2 or more Boneswords if you know they will make it into HTH
quickly. Basically, let the Purestrain Genestealers fight HTH and use
Tyranid Warriors for fire support.

[Image]Termagant Brood:

These little guys make a good shield. I usually buy at least one brood to
place by my Patriarch and Magus.

[Image]Genestealer Brood:

How can you go wrong with a bunch of these guys? The only thing to watch
out for is guns, Daemons, and other models with a 6+ WS. Keep these guys in
groups of 5. While this reduces the power of Catalyst, I have found that I
can rarely get that power off. If you ever get Catalyst off, get in HTH
ASAP and be sneaky and try to keep it from being nullified later on. Units
of 5 also makes them eaiser to control.

[Image]Carnifex:

A Dreadnought with no points limit. If you ever play a 1025 point battle,
be silly, and take 5 Carnifi (my plural for Carnifex). I always try to take
one of these guys. These are also great with the flank march strategy card.

[Image]Hybrid Brood:

These guys kinda stink. They can't hit anything with their WS of 2! If you
must take them, give them 3 Heavy Plasma guns and 2 Flamers (138 points).
Also, give them all a sword and power sword(7 points). The 2 swords is
handy because they give 2 attacks and two parries. Use the HPG because they
always have a blast radius of 1.5" which lets them at least the chance of
hitting something. Multi-melta are also good, but they are kinda expensive.

[Image]Brood Brother Squad:

These guys are pretty good. I have never fielded them because I don't have
any minitures for them. However, I would field them in 10 man units because
then you can get a vehicle for every 10 man unit you have. Talk to an
Imperial Gaurd player to see what they give their Tactical Squads.

[Image]Vehicles:

In the games I have played I have found that vehicles tended to die
quickly. However, the one time I fielded a Sentinel (I borrowed some
Imperial Gaurd to use as Brood Brothers) I was impressed.

[Image]Psychic Power Strategies:

The only two Tyranid psychic powers worth takeing are Catalyst and Psychic
Scream. If I have one Psyker (the Magus) I usually pick 2 Tyranid powers
and 2 Adeptus Powers. When I field two or more Psykers (usually the Magus
and Patriarch) I will have the Magus take one Tyranid power and three
Adeptus powers. All the Adeptus are pretty good. Normally I hope to get at
least one of either The Gate, Assail, or Displacement. With these I usually
move my Purestrains closer to the enemy, or just cause trouble if there is
no where to move squads to. Also, Assail and Displacement are useful for
moving a Carnifex and still having it be able to fire.

[Image]Sample Armies:

My normal 1000, 2000, and 3000 point armies. Note: In my gaming group we
have decided to combine both the Tyranid and the Genestealer army list into
one. However, the Tyranid/Genestealer player is no longer able to take
chaos as an ally. The benefit is that I no longer have to worry about
keeping the number of Tyranids under 50% when I field Genestealers.

   * 1000 Point Army
     Magus - 199 (see above, but replace Bionic Eye with Storm Shield)
     20 Purestrain Genestealers - 400
     2 Tyranid Warrior Broods - 348
     1 Termagant Brood - 40
     (987 Points Total)

   * 2000 Point Army
     Magus - 185 (same as above but without Bionic Eye and replace Plasma
     Gun with Plasma pistol)
     Patriarch - 163
     30 Purestrain Genestealers - 600
     3 Tyranid Warrior Broods - 522
     2 Carnifex - 410
     3 Termagant Broods - 120
     (2000 Points Total)

   * 3000 Point Army
     Magus - 194 (see above)
     Patriarch - 163
     45 Purestrain Genestealers - 900
     3 Carnifex - 615
     3 Tyranid Warrior Broods - 522
     4 Termagant Broods - 160
     1 Sentinel - 75
     20 Brood Brother(Laspistol+Sword) - 365 (all with Power Sword and
     Boltgun. One with an Autocannon. Broken into 2 squads of 10)
     (2994 Points Total)

Also, don't forget that you can field Chaos as an ally. Daemons are well
worth their points right now.

[Image]Small Assorted Pointers:

There are many things to keep in mind when you play a Tyranid/Genestealer
army.

   * For the most part, they are a close combat army.
   * Fire support is generaly lacking.
   * Also, remember that you will probally have a larger amount of big
     models than your opponent.
   * It's also a good idea to be able to judge how long a foot is by eye.
   * This is pretty obvious, but always try to have you Purestrains run or
     charge, having them standing around makes them worthless.
   * One thing I have found handy is to spread my Tyranid Warriors across
     the board. This gives them a larger area to control with the hive
     mind.
   * Even though the Flesh Borer is no longer around, and it remains to be
     seen if it will return, I have one tip for its use. Do not shoot
     directely at the model you want to kill, instead run a Termagant up
     there and shoot the Termagant! (Substitute a Pub in if there are no
     Termagants avaible.) For those of you who know the Flesh Borer rules,
     you should realize what this does. For those of you who have never
     heard of Flesh Borer, pay no attention.
