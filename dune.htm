<h1>Dune Rocks!!!</h1>

<h2>Ah Dune by far the most exciting scince fiction series and computer game of all time.</h2>

<ul>

<li><h1>Dune the Series</h1>

<p>The Dune series started with the book Dune.  After that marvel was revealed 5 others followed.  Theese 6 novels bring the life of House Atreides, House Harkonenn, the Imperium, the other houses of the Lansdraad, the Bene gesserit, the Spacing Guild, Bene Tleilax and many others right into your home.  Thus making you feel your in that orithopter when Paul and Jessica land in the Desert.  So this is why I thnk that when Frank Herbert wrote these novels he was reeally thnking about how real it could be by just adding a little imagination.<p>

<li><h1>Dune the Movie</h1>

<p>Dune the movie was more of a flop, than a real marvel.  They left out the important desrt scene where Paul and Jessica were stranded and at the mercy of Worms until they found the fremen.  However it was also made back in the 80's so everything looked preety stupid except the worms and Gurney.  the only part I liked was when Piter died I didn't like him so I was glad he died.  Duncan on the other hand looked stupid but was cool.  There sheild belts were pretty cool, but could use some work.</p>

<li><h1>Dune and DuneII the Computer Games</h1>

<p>Dune the Computer game was higly succesfull as a game that no one had ever heard of.  Now even though that dsen't make any sense, I have my own twisted logic so...LIVE WITH IT BUDDY!  Annnyway, Dune used and went with what the book's said pretty well as the movie didn't but that's O.K.
     Dune II won best strategy game award in 1993, which say's a lot.  I t has almost nothing to with Dune except for The Imperial Sardaukar, House Atreides, house  Harkonenn, and House Ordos which I have never heard of.  But is probally the best thing Dune has ever credited.  Both games were made with help Virgin games inc.  Dune was co produced by Cryo Interactive entertainment, and Dune II was mainly produced by Westwood Studios.  Oh and one more thing, Westwood Studios recently came out with Dune the battle for Arrakis for Sega genesis!
