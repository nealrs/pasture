<h1>WARHAMMER 40000</h1>

<h2><B>Warhammer 40k is a science fiction game played in the 41 millennium with plastic and pewter miniatures.  Although they might be expensive the game is great!</b></h2>

<h1>Major Races</h1>

<p>If you wan't to know what I think of the major races then look no further for this is the place.</p>

<h2>MARINES</h2>

<p>The Marines are bioenhanced human warriors.  Space marines are Divided into armies or chapters.  The most famous chapter's are the Space Wolves, Blood Angles, Dark Angeles, and the Ultramarines.  Marine Armies are very powerful on the Battlefield and Almost any chapter will do.  I personally don't play Marines but if I did I would play Dark Angels.</p>

<h2>IMPERIAL GUARD</h2>

<p>The Imperial Guard is a force raised from over a million Imperial planets to protect the galaxy from the ravaging forces of evil such as Space Orks, Chaos, and the Tyranids.  The Imperial Gaurd may be good for they have jamproof weapons but other that that I think they are close to the worst race so don't play with the Imperial guard unless using them as allies.  The only good thing about them is that they have good ling range support and lots of vehicles.</p>

<h2>ELDAR:MY TEAM</h2>

<p>The Eldar are an ancient but advanced race almost wiped out except for those aboard the large star spanning space hulks known as Craftworlds.  There biggest enemies are Chaos and the Tyranids.  The Eldar race is a strange one in the sense their technologies are based upon psycho-plastics that are molded under physic pressure, and that their gods do directly interact with their in the sense that their god's are actually alive and can be touched.  Eldar are a very good army for all around strength they have vehicles, characters, support, allies, psykers, heavy weapons, close and long range weapons and aspect warriors.  So if you want a good army at a moderate price choose an Eldar army!</p>


<h2>SPACE ORKS</h2>

<p>Space Orks are in a way goblins from outer space.  They come in mass quantity and their motto is quantity over quality!  They are good is you like commanding huge armies because they cost so little in points that you can mass hordes of Orks and win easily.  I don't play Ork's because there to evil and there are to many different kinds but Ork's are a good choice if you want lot's of vehicles long range support and other mean and cruel thingys.  If you are going to play Orks I would suggest getting the Ork boss of each kind of Ork you are playing with such as the Freebooter Boss or the Evil Sunz Boss, and so on.  So remember if you want a army based on quantity and are evil to the bone choose Ork's!!

<h2>TYRANIDS</h2>

<p>The Tyranids are bio-constructs.  There plan is to take over the universe and dominate it with more Tyranids.  Tyranids are usually bio-constructed creatures that look like nothing like humans, but their are genestealer Hybrids that are Humans that have been mutated into Tyranids.  Tyranids attack planets by traveling on space hulks.  Space hulks are large deserted ships that float through the galaxy.  When they reach a planet they get off and ravage the planet.  Eldar Craftworlds are examples of space hulks.  My Eldar forces have been getting their buts kicked because of my only opponent's Tyranids.  <b>Please if you  know anyone within the 15217 area code in Pittsburgh PA who is willing to play with a 12 year old who sucks then write to me at <a href="mailto:nshyam@winchester.pp.psc.edu">nshyam@winchester.pp.psc.edu</a></address></b>  Tyranids are cheap point wise and are quite good.  I don't play Tyranids because they are UGLY!!!  But if you want another massive force in addition to Orks check out Tyranids.


<h2>For right now I am not writing about any other forces such as Chaos for they are to evil for me but keep looking because maybe in a little while you will find them.</h2>

<h1>Conversions</h1>

<p>This is where I will keep all my tips on conversions that I get from other pages because I have no creativity!!  If anyone thinks I am copying their tips, well then  I am verys orry!!</p>

<h3>Hive Tyrant Conversion</h3>

<p>I know that the Real Hive Tyrant is coming out in a while but anyway, if you wan't to make a Hive Tyrant that will still look cool, then read on.  Just take a Death Spitter and a pair of Bone Swors from a Tyranid Warrior weapon Sprue, The Queen Alien plastic toy, and a monster base and glue toghter with some ZAP-A-GAP!</p>
